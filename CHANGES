PREVIEW // 2015-06-25

        new: when an unsupported ovftool version was detected we now continue
             instead of aborting (giving a hint of course)
        new/fix: complete rewrite of the ESX firewall readme
                - using copy and paste is a mess in esx ssh so added a here doc to
                  add all the relevant code in a readable manner
                - changes regarding the esxcli commands to be better prepared and setup
        fix: VM info refresh sometimes opening main screen instead of refreshing
        new: (internal) infobox window now supports error messages without exiting
        new(!): (VM editor) added coresPerSocket support!
        fix(!): (VM editor) problems when total cpu count is 1 which means unset by esx
        fix: (VM editor) wrong console detection
        fix: (VM editor) wording to "validate" instead "activate" changes
        fix(!): (VM editor) comparison of change detection was not working
        fix(!): (VM editor) upload window was shown even when there were no changes
        new(!): (VM editor) added calculation for cores per socket and total cpu count
        new: (VM editor) added a little bit more debug output to console action
        fix(!): (VM editor) removed debug code so the editor works again
        fix: (VM editor) added a check if console setting has changed by user and
             do the change if needed (only)
        fix(!): (VM editor) a problem with RAM detection
        fix(!): (VM editor) a problem with CPU count detection
        new(!): introduced several ESX operation actions!
               now you can do the following operations on your ESX:
               - enter maintenance mode
               - exit maintenance mode
               - reboot (requires maintenance mode = on)
               - shutdown (requires maintenance mode = on)
        new: some preparations for new deploy mode
        new: hint for v6.0 perl SDK in README
		new: added a skip-button for creating vEMan desktop icon when installing
		new(!): introducing the first official vEMan Compendium!!!! Check it out on the project page.
		fix: license was not displayed correctly on smaller screens.. 
		new: changed development CVS tool to GIT instead of SVN. GIT is so damn great.. 
		new: identical info header in all important documents
		new(!): added a TROUBLEshooting file with important hints if you run into problems
				AND: cleaned up README, UPGRADE, INSTALL accordingly
		fix: Download-links for OVFtool
		new: easy howto for Ubuntu added to INSTALL documentation
		fix(!): re-coded ovftool handling because v2.0.1 was removed by VMware
		new(!): added a brain for target servers you already contacted. it will
			also show the last used server preselected for your convenience.
			I like it so much ;o)
		new(!): introduced an XML parser we need for the VM Editor - because of this and because
			 vEMan will base on python in the future I change the requirements.
			 from now on python at least v2.5 is a requirement for running all functions of vEMan
			 This XML parser gives a little speed improvement when displaying the VMs information.
		fix: some vars cleaning in sysvars_vEMan.cfgs
		new(!): WHEN UPGRADING - READ THE UPGRADE GUIDE! The uservars_vEMan.cfg have changed!!!!!
		new: fixed fileaccess.pl because it returns absolutely no errorcode as return value. "Great" work VMware..
		fix: be more tolerant when deploying OVF/OVA
		new: added cpu core detection of ESX in hostinfo.pl
		new: added a generic check for the power state as a new module
		new(!): well long long LONG time it took and tried about 4 completely different concepts but now the
				VM editor is near of ready to use and provides the following features:
				- FUNCTIONAL but need some more validations (not bullet-proof):
					- Detect & change RAM (will validate the max available RAM!)
					- Detect & change Display Name
					- Detect & change VM network (only first NIC supported atm)
					- Detect & change number of CPUs (will validate the max available CPU cores!)
				- PARTLY FUNCTIONAL / WORK-IN-PROGRESS: 
					- Detect & change VNC console port and state
				- KNOWN-ISSUES:
					It needs some more work on flushing the caches but in the meantime use the refresh button
					(several times) if the VM is still not in on/offline state e.g. That is not a specific
					problem within the VM editor module but a generic one..
		new: added some more hints to the installation process of the VMware SDK
		new: updated installation info for fedora in INSTALL
	
		Have fun! 

v0.9.6  // 2013-03-25	new: some troubleshooting tip in upgrade guide
			new(!): ATTENTION -> READ the UPGRADE guide when you have a 
				previous version of vEMan running (user settings cannot be upgraded)
			new(!): added a simple user management:
				- list users
				- add a new user (including shell access and role)
				- change user (password, role, shell access)
				- added check for 8 chars in password because of ESX requirements (warn only)
			new: added a simple info box handler (displays a message without 'Cancel' option)
			fix: catching unusable OVF/VMX sources in VM deployment (this will NOT catch all deploy 
				problems but will validate the OVF/VMX. It is possible that you have a valid 
				OVF/VMX but it will not work together with your ESX (e.g. 'vmx-08' was not working 
				in my ESXi v4.1. So in short atm the moment I will catch problems with the logical 
				syntax of an OVF/VMX but do not test it against your target (that may never happen). 
				I still need to implement a better error handling after the deploy process 
				ended. Thats not that easy because of the yad progress bar etc.- we will see ;o) ). 
			fix: even when error occured in VM deployment vEMan had tried to enable console
			fix: when deploying a VM a source with special characters crashed vEMan
			fix(!): when an empty VM-Status caching file exists vEMan shows always the status symbol 
				(without a VM name)
			        that may had result in strange displayed list in some special cases or the symbol 
				was displayed even without a VM name (even when you know that there have to be one).
			fix(!):	moved all caching files to the personal	ESX-folder (~/.vEMan/your-esx-server/) 
				instead of having it all directly in the ~/.vEMan working dir. This will also ensure that 
				'overlappings' (displaying VMs from another esx) will not happen in the future anymore.
				This also may fix different other problems especially fixes all problems when running
				vEMan twice or more the same time. This is possible from now on because session cookies
				etc are all saved in the esx-working-dir.
			fix: caching file for suspended VMs was not deleted when vEMan exited
			fix: when deploying the scan for available network names with spaces within the name failed
			fix: when you deploy a VM and select "Power on after deployed" the VM was not powered on
			fix: display GUI info messages in the logfile, too
			fix(!): deployment to ESX 5.1 was not possible
			fix: added vEMan version info to log
			fix(!): fixed several bugs regarding the VM list:
				- When ESX has sleeping VMs ONLY
				- When no online AND no sleeping VMs on your ESX server
				- When no online VMs but offline AND sleeping ones
			fix(!): Console not working with ESX 5.1 or higher (now displaying user howto for ESX-FW setup)

v0.9.5 // 2012-12-06	fix: the VM online list not refreshes in all cases
			fix: the VM suspended list never refreshes
			fix: the VM offline list not refreshes in all cases

v0.9.4 // 2012-10-06	fix(!): another converting bug.. disabling console was not working because of a damn carriage return..
			new: Console manager will not stay open after click on action (open,disable,enable) instead closes automatically after pressed
			fix: no popup anymore after closing console (VNC is not able to export a valid return code so we raise a warning only)
			new(!): complete rewrite of power manager.. the manager will close automatically after choosing an action
			new(!): when doing a power action (reboot,shutdown ...) 
				the user will be prompted for confirmation now (before the action was performed without any confirmation)
			new: added docs dir to the sysconfig
			new: added an option for reviewing/rating vEMan
			new: added a human readable license with the option to read the full one

v0.9.3 // 2012-08-07	new(!): Detecting storages when deploying OVF/VMX
        			That means we detect:
			        - available storages on ESX
			        - type of storage
			        - capacity of storage
			        - free space of storage
			        vEMan offers the detected storages as a combo selection box with the option of manual filling
			fix: Host Manager was not able to display 'not-ready-yet' message
			new(!): Detecting networks when deploying OVF/VMX as a combo selection box with the option of manual filling
			new/fix: Well the suspended VMs were not displayed anymore - I believe because of a change a while ago.
	 			 This is working again now and vEMan displays a cool suspend icon for them ;o)			
			new(!): introducing the ESX Host Manager (displays information only atm):
					- boottime
					- cpumodel, cpuspeed, cpuusage
					- memorysize, memoryusage
					- maintenancemode, rebootrequired, software (which ESX version is running)
			new: added a NOTREADY function for features which are planned but not fully implemented

v0.9.1 // 2012-07-26	fix(!): Snapshots should work again!
			fix(!): beeing more robust when detecting VM paths.. (fixes some errors when you have multiple VMs where
				the name is mainly the same. E.g. when you have VM01 and VM01-dev then you ran into problems
				when it comes to open console, power settings, etc which is fixed now
			fix: When clicking on 'ESX Manager' nothing has happened because of typo in module name
			new: updated UPGRADE guide to reflect changes to the new vEMan installer
			new: updated INSTALL guide to reflect the same and added INIT info to enforce a new installation

v0.9.0 // 2012-07-17	new: display license banner when executed first time
			new: started to code a simple installer for vEMan			
			new: enforce first time startup by --init option
			new(!): yeeeeha.. Delete VM's is available now (VM Manager) -> tested with not renamed VMs
			fix: keep-alive handler was not working as expected in some cases which results in connection loss
			fix: after deploying OVF/VMX dialog was not closed automatically
			new: added a mini help in vEMan main window
			new: settings for OVF/VMX deployment are saved in a ESX specific directory and prefilled next time
			new: refresh VM list after deleting a VM
			fix: added a info box that deploying the VM succeeded
			fix: some minor code cleanups

v0.8.5 // 2012-07-03	fix: vEMan can started from everywhere now! -> very good for e.g. creating a desktop shortcut
			fix: if path contains spaces vEMan failed to start 
			fix: moved certs dir to the user config dir instead of the vEMan path
			fix: if certs directory does not exist create it
			fix: removed direct OVF deployment at login popup (too much problems)
			fix: renamed log file and moved place to the vEMan settings dir (I try to separate things)
			new(!): Big change behind the scenes: 
				I have splitted all functions out of runFUNCTION in order to get more clean code
				and better handling even in case of updating.
			new: added Control-C and/or 'SIGINT' detection and do a clean exit
			fix: in some cases the keepalive handler have not stopped
			fix: no progress bar when deploying OVF/VMX
			fix: when trying to deploy a second OVF/VMX the previous settings were always taken
			new: sort online and offline VMs alphabetically
			new: thanks to the splitting of all modules it is possible now to start a specific
				module of vEMan with the syntax: "./vEMan <FUNCTION NAME>"
				e.g: "./vEMan F_DEPLOVF"
				This makes troubleshooting a module much easier..
			new: added a HELP to vEMan to explain the commandline possibilities
			fix: removed Proxy line because it seems no one needs that and would take 
				(too) much time to implement for a maybe unused feature.

v0.8.4 // 2012-05-14	fix: added 'yad' to requirement check and therfor to sysvars
				and replaced hardcoded yad cmd with variable.
			fix(!): added a keepalive function so the session will not time-out anymore
				by default it do a keepalive every 2 minutes which is working fine for me.
				You can adjust that setting in etc/sysvars_vEMan.cfg (examples are described there)
			new: example commands in the latest upgrade guide, some changes in README und INSTALL

v0.8.3 // 2012-04-27 	The major reason for this update is because of PERL. Before v0.8.2 I was working on 
			Ubuntu 11.04 and had no problems using vEMan. But last week I decided to upgrade to 11.10
			because of the upcoming 12.04 release and well the problems started.. I can't even connect
			to my ESX servers anymore but it still worked on my 10.04 Lucid server.. First thought was the 
			VMware Perl Toolkit by VMware, because I changed that to v5.0 from 4.1, too but it has made
			no difference. I then come to some Forum entries pointing to maybe a certificate-verify issue
			and so I tried to integrate a cert-downloader with the option to import that ESX certificate
			somewhere - /etc/ssl/certs e.g. Well I tried a lot around this part but never got a successful
			connection.
			Doing searches in the web again and again and then finally found a sooo simple solution that it
			hurts :o) So, have fun with vEMan v0.8.3 - it may work now on machines where you saw the error
			"Server version unavailable at [....]" before ..

			fix: download link for OVFtool (VMware has changed URL to myvmware)
			new: added download link when ovftool is missing
			new(!): SSL-certificate-checking is DISABLED by default now. 
				This avoid the annoying error: "Server version unavailable at esx......"
				If you want to enable strict SSL certificate checking adjust the variable: 
				PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME=1 (instead of "0") in "etc/sysvars_vEMan.cfg"
			new: fetching the SSL certificate from the ESX (saved to ./certs) 
				Well that was mainly a try to get the above error solved but you can use
				it to copy the downloaded certificate to your local cert-store - 
				don't forget that if you want to do strict cert checking you also need to adjust 
				the above variable to "1"
			new(!): Deploying the VMware apps together with vEMan! This is made possible because of:
				http://communities.vmware.com/viewwebdoc.jspa?documentID=DOC-10141
				Because of this I moved the corresponding path variable from
				"etc/uservars_vEMan.cfg" to "etc/sysvars_vEMan.cfg" to keep the uservars file
				small and simple
			fix: description for all main variables in etc/sysvars_vEMan.cfg added
			new: speeding up the first auth check by using connect.pl instead of a full VM scan
			fix: in case of auth error the old logon screen was shown
			fix: wrong user/pw will be detected now and a meaningful message is displayed instead 
				of the generic one
			fix(!): when the user enters a wrong password he cannot login even with the correct password 
				until he closes and open vEMan again
			fix: detection if session file was created or not so vEMan will not start anymore in case of error.
			new: added a copy of the CC license to vEMan

v0.8.2 // 2012-04-20	new: I use the VMware Perl SDK v5.0 from now on for all my tests and new features so you may want 
				to switch to v5 SDK, too which is recommended from now on.
			new(!): supporting the display and management of VMs in resource pools 
				(well ressource pools names will not be displayed atm).
			fix: improved the detection of the VM on/off state
			new(!): introduced the power manager - isn't that great :o)) I like it soo much
				- start
				- resume
				- stop
				- reset
				- shutdown
				- reboot
				- standby
			new(!): doubleclick on a VM displays useful information 
				(CPU/RAM usage, vmtools state and much more..)
			new(!): introduced the ! indicator in CHANGES file (this file) 
				for important fixes / features /adjustments
			new(!): restructering of the menu buttons and logic 
				-> that means a doubleclick on a VM will open a VM Manager now:
				- 1) VM information including CPU,... usage
				- 2) Buttons for VM specific operations like console,power,....
				- 3) removed those links from vEMan main screen
				- 4) added buttons for the upcoming new features I'm working on like ESX management,VM editor
			new: I proudly introduce the first official vEMan Logo at Logon screen and in title bar 
				- I hope you like it ;o)
			fix: renamed the main button to "Login" at the logon window (named "VM Magement" before)
			new(!): introduced the snapshot manager - yeeha ;o)
				- List current snapshots
				- Create a new snapshot (without memory dump)
				- Remove a selected snapshot (single)
				- Remove a selected snapshot + all sub-snapshots (children)
				- Revert to a selected snapshot

v0.8.1 // 2012-04-12	fix(!): requirement checks were made but vEMan didnt exit when not ok
			new: added version number in title

v0.8.0 // 2012-04-11	new(!): WOW... took me 3 FULL days but now all VMs will:
				- be checked for online/offline
				- a status picture will be displayed before each VM! I like it soooo much ;o)
				known issue is that suspended VMs will be displayed as OFF. For me it is not a prob
				so if it is for you let me know ;o)
			new(!): added a pics/ dir within vEman package for displaying on/off state
			fix(!): whoo.. There were several errors and problems solved regarding the detection
				and handling of Console sessions. Now everything should work as expected..
				- detection changed to detect the enabled feature instead of port 
				- activating console will enforce activation without further checking
				- open console will now detect correctly if console is available or not
				- duplicated usage of ports when enabling console
			fix: return vEMan main window again after error msg for power settings
			new: tested deployment of VMX (works like a charme..)
			new: added an etc/ dir for vEMan 
			new(!): splitted functions from code
			new(!): created a function-runner
			new(!): splitted system variables from code
			new(!): WOOT... well i have changed everything regarding the function handling - this
				is a really REALLY BIG change in code so I hope everything is still working for
				you. Nevertheless this part was necessary to made because of new cool features and ease up debugging.
			fix: the username var was changed to a unique one instead of $USER to avoid probs
			new(!): we hash the password (AES 256 CNC) and save the hash in the settings file for better 
				interaction of the new file/folder structure. This requires openssl from now on!
			new: replaced 'Activate console','Disable console' and 'Open console' by 'Console Manager' at the vEMan
				main screen because I need more space for other functions in vEMan that will come next.
				--> two of them are the buttons 'Snapshot Manager' and 'Power Manager' which are placeholders atm
			new(!): now it is possible to have more than 1 console window open at one time
			new: added 'OVF/VMX Deploy' button to the main screen of vEMan
			new: replaced 'Deploy OVF' and 'Deploy VMX' at the login window to 'Deploy OVF/VMX'
			new: displaying a short help when mouse-over in the console-manager
			new: added progress bar when collecting VM list data
			fix: there was no error msg displayed when user not selected a VM for:
				- console manager
				- power manager
				- snapshot manager
			new: added a progress bar when vEMan is starting (preparing vEMan)
			new: added an exit function for clean and defined exit
			fix: in some circumstances the session data etc were not removed when exiting
			fix: refresh VM list was not fresh enough
			fix: when you started vEMan and wanted to close it you need to do that two times
			fix: exiting vEMan was not possible in some cases
			fix: some misunderstanding wording regarding the console
