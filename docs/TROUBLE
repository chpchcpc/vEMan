Good to know:

    You can start vEMan from the commandline! There are several
    options available, simply check:
    
    $> ./vEMan --help

    For the most problems I recommend to start vEMan from the commandline which
    may help in many cases to find out the root problem of your issue.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A) vEMan doesn't start!

    If vEMan cannot be started ensure you have the correct permissions:

    $> cd [INSTALL-DIR]/vEMan_vXXX/
    $> chmod -R +x vEMan ./libs/ ./vmapps/

    You should then start vEMan from the commandline by:
    
    $> ./vEMan
    
    and take a briefly look on the output vEMan gives.

C) Problem XYZ occurs!

    Start vEMan from the commandline, check output and
    
    check the log file which is created within your home dir:

    $> cat ~/.vEMan/vEMan.log

D) Where is my vEMan start icon? -or- I want to re-install vEMan!

    If you cannot find your Desktop icon of vEMan it should also be a copy within your vEMan directory.
    If not or if you want to re-init the installation (reinstall) you can do so by:
        $> [INSTALL-DIR]/vEMan --init

E) vEMan does not work after an upgrade!

    When that happens I hope you have read the corresponding UPGRADE guide? If you have followed the
    guide you will have your old version in place so you can still use the working one to keep
    productive. Ok so the most reasons for upgrade issues are that there were changes within the
    config files of vEMan or you haven't followed the UPGRADE guide correctly.
    
    1. Read and follow the UPGRADE guide step-by-step!
    2. start vEMan from the commmandline.
    3. Check Output and Log (see A+C).
