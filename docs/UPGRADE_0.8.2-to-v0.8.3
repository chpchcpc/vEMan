Upgrading vEMan is easy ;-)
-----------------------------------

***************************************************************************************************
Keep in mind that vEMan is currently in BETA state and so there can be heavy changes in:
code, 
file structure, 
variables and
files. 
That means also that in this state an upgrade may require manual changes and/or re-adding your 
configuration options and the behaviour of functions can change.
***************************************************************************************************

Even if I encountered no problems when using VMware SDK for Perl Toolkit v4.x I recommend using v5.x for vEMan.
Since v0.8.2 vEMan is based on the current v5.0 VMware SDK for Perl that means my tests will be done for v5.x only.

The v0.8.2 introduced VMCLIPATH variable was moved to the systemvars file instead of uservars file.

That means I recommend to upgrade like this:
1) Rename your current vEMan folder
2) Create a new empty folder
3) Download the new vEMan version
4) unpack it to the created dir in 2)
5) chmod -R +x vEMan ./libs/ ./vmapps/
6) change the values in uservars_vEMan.cfg to match your installation (do NOT copy the old cfg file!)

If the new vEMan version works as expected you can delete the folder you renamed in 1) otherwise 
you can easily switch back to the previous version.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The alternative upgrade option (NOT recommended):
1) do all steps mentioned above from 1 to 4 (stop after 4)
2) copy the old uservars_vEMan.cfg from your previous version and delete or outcomment the var: "VMCLIPATH". 
3) Check carefully if you don't miss any variable (compare with the downloaded one maybe a diff -s .. ).

If you do all fine vEMan will start - otherwise start vEman in a terminal to see which requirements can't be checked.
I do not recommend that way because their can be problems occur later on which can be hard to find, so it would be 
better to to the recommended way above.
