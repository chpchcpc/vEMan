Please read the README file also inside this package.
Within the README you will find all requirements you need to met before you can use vEMan.

1) Install the requirements as described within the README
	some hints about some specials:
	a) use the following command to install VMware SDK:
	   $> sudo -i (or su BUT NEVER sudo -s!)
	   $> http_proxy="" ftp_proxy="" ./vmware-install.pl -d

	b) the VMware SDK HAVE TO end with the following message:
		The installation of vSphere CLI 5.1.0 build-780721 for Linux completed 
		successfully. You can decide to remove this software from your system at any 
		time by invoking the following command: 
		"/usr/bin/vmware-uninstall-vSphere-CLI.pl".
		This installer has successfully installed both vSphere CLI and the vSphere SDK 
		for Perl.
	   (or similar but it HAVE TO be something like that! otherwise the install has not finished correctly)

2) unpack vEMan in a temporary directory
        $> mv vEMan_vxX.tgz /tmp 
	$> cd /tmp
	$> tar xvzf vEMan_vxX.tgz

3) start vEMan from within the temporary directory
        $> cd vEMan_vXXX/
        $> chmod +x && ./vEMan (the installer guides you through the rest of installation)

4) start vEMan
	Debug output:
	$> [INSTALL-DIR]/vEMan
	Normal startup:
	Double click on the vEMan Desktop icon


Troubleshooting:

        If vEMan cannot be started ensure you have the correct permissions:
	        $> cd [INSTALL-DIR]/vEMan_vXXX/
       	 	$> chmod -R +x vEMan ./libs/ ./vmapps/

	If you cannot find your Dekstop icon of vEMan you can simply re-init the installation by:
		$> [INSTALL-DIR]/vEMan --init

	When you get an error message about proxy while installing
	the VMware SDK you need to use:
		- sudo http_proxy="" ftp_proxy="" ./vmware-install.pl
		or (when you are user root)
		- http_proxy="" ftp_proxy="" ./vmware-install.pl

	Distribution specific:

		on Fedora (17) you need to have those packages installed for vEMan and the VMware SDK:
		- sudo yum install libuuid-devel yad cpan perl-XML-LibXML 

		on Ubuntu (tested on 12.04) you should run this otherwise SDK will NOT install:
		- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager
		- sudo apt-get update
		- sudo apt-get install yad libxml-libxml-perl libssl-dev
