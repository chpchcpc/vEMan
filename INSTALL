####################################################################################

Please read the README file first(!).
Within the README you will find all requirements you need to met before you can use vEMan.

1) Install the requirements as described within the README
        some hints about some specials:
        a) use the following command to install VMware SDK:
           $> sudo -i (or su BUT NEVER sudo -s!)
           $> http_proxy="" ftp_proxy="" ./vmware-install.pl -d

        b) the VMware SDK HAVE TO end with the following message:
                The installation of vSphere CLI 5.1.0 build-780721 for Linux completed 
                successfully. You can decide to remove this software from your system at any 
                time by invoking the following command: 
                "/usr/bin/vmware-uninstall-vSphere-CLI.pl".
                This installer has successfully installed both vSphere CLI and the vSphere SDK 
                for Perl.
           (or similar but it HAVE TO be something like that! otherwise the install has not finished correctly)

2) unpack vEMan in a temporary directory
        $> mv vEMan_vxX.tgz /tmp 
        $> cd /tmp
        $> tar xvzf vEMan_vxX.tgz

3) start vEMan from within the temporary directory
        $> cd vEMan_vXXX/
        $> chmod +x && ./vEMan (the installer guides you through the rest of installation)

4) start vEMan after installation:
        Double click on the vEMan Desktop icon :o)


Installation problems:

    When you get an error message about proxy while installing the VMware SDK you need to use:
        $> sudo http_proxy="" ftp_proxy="" ./vmware-install.pl
           or (when you are user root)
        $> http_proxy="" ftp_proxy="" ./vmware-install.pl

    When you can't get the OVFtool v2.0.1 even not with the hints from the README file you
    can install OVFtool v3 instead. vEMan will start then but you can NOT deploy VMs but
    using all other functions.

Distribution specific convenience hints:

    on Fedora (17) you need to have those packages installed for vEMan and the VMware SDK:
        $> sudo yum install libuuid-devel yad cpan perl-XML-LibXML 

    on Ubuntu (tested on 12.04) you should run this otherwise SDK will NOT install:
        (for a recent yad version:) $> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager
        $> sudo apt-get update
        $> sudo apt-get install yad libxml-libxml-perl libssl-dev
