Known Issues
--------------

	If you encounter issues you can use the subversion repo which may contain fixes for your problem already.
	The most fresh code can be checked out this way:

	svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/veman/source/trunk vEMan_trunk
	or if the svn ports are blocked on your site:
	svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/veman/source/trunk vEMan_trunk

	Or simply browse the Repository and download single files by HTTP:
	
	http://sourceforge.net/p/veman/source/


Requirements
---------------

	Because vEMan is based on VMware and other great tools you need to ensure that you have the following installed:

	1) VMware Perl Toolkit (*) 
	2) The VMware ovftool (**)

	Besides the VMware requirements you need to have some standard Linux tools installed to get vEMan running:

	netcat, yad (***), a vncviewer (like tightvncviewer or similar), openssl, bash, grep, sed, python (v2.5 or higher)


Variables
----------------

	Please read the INSTALL file before starting vEMan.
	You can find a variables file included in this package which you should modify according to your installation.
	If the file is missing vEMan will create an example file for you.


HELP
---------------

	If you struggle somewhere you can get community help at the vEMan project page on sourceforge.net!
